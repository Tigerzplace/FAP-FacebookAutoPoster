Done 6 oct, 2021

Textarea & issue. (fixed)
First feedback: Keyword based selection of groups. (done)


Remaining 

Second feedback: a pause button will be very appreciated! Sometimes users need to pause sharing to hit only the better hours.

Third feedback: I know writing an extension absorb time and energy, so don't receive this third feedback like a criticism! ðŸ˜… Why don't exploit the regular sharing option above facebook posts?
If I can give to extension a link of a post, maybe it can share it selecting groups one by one lik on these screens..
The difference is all interactions will be registered directly on the post's insight. What do you think?

Fifth feedback: is it possible to make extension to comment below each shared?
I.e. a point . and immediately delete it, to get shares back to the top.
