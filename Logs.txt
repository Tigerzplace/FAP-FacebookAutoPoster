v1.6 – Smarter Campaigns, Pause Button, Cleaner UI, Stability & UX Upgrade

New: Pause / Resume Button
- You can now pause an active posting campaign at any time.
- Perfect if you want to quickly stop, review the logs, or change something before continuing.

New: Post URL Display
- After each successful post, FAP now shows the direct Facebook URL in the logs.
- Quickly open, verify or share your posts without searching in Facebook manually.

New: Save & Load Campaigns
- Save your favourite group selections and post settings as named “Campaigns”.
- Load any saved campaign in one click – no need to reselect groups or reconfigure timings every time.
- Great for recurring promotions, weekly posts, or multiple niches.

New: Extended Wait-Time Options (Safer Posting)
- More flexible fixed and custom wait times between posts.
- Set your own min/max delay window for multi-post campaigns.
- First post starts immediately, and the waiting logic is smarter to avoid unnecessary delays while still keeping things FB-safe.

Improved: Logs & Toastr Notifications
- Event log auto-scrolls to the latest entry, so you always see what’s happening right now.
- “Clear Logs” button to reset the log area with a single click.
- Log messages are cleaner and easier to read: `[time] STATUS message` (no extra clutter).
- Group names / links in the log are clickable again, so you can NOW jump straight to the post in the group.
- Toast popups are more accurate and consistent: real success vs error messages with better styling.

Improved: Progress Bar & Mode B UX
- Progress bar is easier to read at all stages (text stays visible even around 50%+ fill).
- The bar hides automatically when it’s not needed to keep the interface clean.
- Overall Mode B posting flow is smoother and more informative while your campaign runs.

🛠 Minor Fixes & Optimizations

   - If any file is tampered with, the extension automatically reloads, disabling itself to prevent unauthorized modifications.

- Debug Mode Control:
   - Implemented a debug mode flag (`DEBUG_MODE`). When debug mode is off, all `console` outputs are disabled to ensure sensitive information is not exposed in production.

   - Updated license module for better reliability and integration with the automatic buying method.

- CORS Issue Fix:
   - Resolved CORS issue with media uploads by updating request headers and modifying the background script.
