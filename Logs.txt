--------------------
v1.5.3

- Integrity Check for Code Protection:
   - Added an integrity check function to ensure code authenticity. The extension verifies SHA-256 hashes of core JavaScript files in the `js` folder.
   - If any file is tampered with, the extension automatically reloads, disabling itself to prevent unauthorized modifications.

- Debug Mode Control:
   - Implemented a debug mode flag (`DEBUG_MODE`). When debug mode is off, all `console` outputs are disabled to ensure sensitive information is not exposed in production.

- License Module Update:
   - Updated license module for better reliability and integration with the automatic buying method.

- CORS Issue Fix:
   - Resolved CORS issue with media uploads by updating request headers and modifying the background script.

- Background Script Improvements:
   - Added dynamic retrieval of extension ID.
   - Configured rules to set the `Origin` header to `https://www.facebook.com` for extension-initiated requests.
   - Restricted rules to only apply to requests containing the extension ID.

- Performance Optimization:
   - Optimized `loginCheck` function for faster profile handling, enhancing overall efficiency.
